### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite of mine because evem though it was an easy lab to do, 
    it started my coding journey. Learning how to create a file, how to clone a 
    git link, adding, commiting, and pushing a repository was the beginning of 
    learning how to code. Then finally seeing hello world at the end, and seeing 
    a check mark next to the lab made me happy about coding and less stressed.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was a favorite of mine as well as it got me in the motion of coding, 
    learning how to initialize, and how to print. I liked that I can test my code 
    by inserting a noun or verb it made me feel accomplished. What got me stuck a 
    lot was formatting as the lab was very precise but after a couple tries I was 
    able to pass the lab.

* Lab 11

    As we got to later in the year the labs got harder, nothing like the first two. 
    What I had liked about this lab was one that I passed it both parts in one class 
    session but also that I finally understood how to make for loops and if statements 
    correctly. Passing this lab really made me happy as it wasn't easy in the slightest
    but I was able to complete it.
